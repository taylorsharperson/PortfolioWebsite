        <p>My current involvement consists of Homeless Solutions and Table of Hope. </p>
        <p> Regarding my work for Homeless Solutions and Table of Hope, I was a food server and served breakfast and dinner two to three times a month for four years. I enjoyed my time involved and loved helping as many people as I could.
          </p>
          <p>
          I also was in charge of a Thanksgiving food drive and rasing money to furnish apartments for Homeless Solutions. 
          My role in the Thanksgiving food drive was prominent. I was in charge of organizing who donated what and sending the canned food to Homeless Solutions. The task was straightforward: I made a form to organize everything and coordinated with everyone to ensure everything was in order. In terms of the fundraiser I raised enough money to fully furnish an apartment with furniture, rugs, etc. I even got to see the apartment when it was done! It looked amazing.

      <p>This is an example of one of the mobile food pantrys which deliver goods to those who are homeless. There is also an in person option as well, which I often particpated in. </p>
        <p>During COVID I particpated in drive by food drives in order to still serve food while adhering to COVID guidelines. They were a great alternative way to serve the community while keeping everyone safe.</p>
