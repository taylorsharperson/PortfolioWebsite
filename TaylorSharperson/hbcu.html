      <h1>HBCU Life</h1>
        <p>I currently attend FAMU, and it is an excellent school. In the fall, my friends and I attended many football games. On a typical day, we often work together, and on the weekends, we go to the mall, park, or out to eat. One thing that I also love about my HBCU is that we encourage each other to do great things. My friends and I constantly push each other to try new things and be the best we can be.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>So far, I have enjoyed my time at FAMU. Although I am a freshman, I have experienced so much and learned much as well. For example, I am involved in the College of Science and Technology Living Learning Community. Within the LLC, I have maintained a 3.3 GPA, met many people within my major, and stayed on top of my studies as well as LLC events. Those events range from meetings to weekly study hours and fun activities in the game day room. My first-year experience has been unparalleled because of the LLC, and I have thrived academically.
